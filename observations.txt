Widgets are visual components of a window, like buttons and textboxes.
In fltk, we extend the Fl_Button class to add new event handling member functions.
Using inheritence, we can customise the Fl_Button class.

Static variables are useful in holding variables which would otherwise
be global without being attached to a class. This makes the program more
organised.
